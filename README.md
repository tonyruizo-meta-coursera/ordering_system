# Three main objectives

1. Create new functions to solve specific problems.
2. Gain experience of using for loops to iterate over different data collections.
3. Create and use data structures to store, retrieve and loop over data.

## Exercise Instructions

1. Open the script ordering_system.py present inside the project folder.

2. Run the script and, when requested, enter in the three products of your choice
   based on the menu - 1 = espresso,
   2 = coffee etc.

3. To run the script, open terminal and execute the following command.

   ```python
   python3 ordering_system.py
   ```

4. Extend the script to have a new function called `calculate_subtotal`.  
   It should accept one argument which is the order list and return the sum  
   of the prices of the items in the order list.

5. Implement `calculate_tax()` which calculates the tax of the subtotal.  
   The tax percentage is 15% of overall bill.

6. Implement `summarize_order()` which returns a list of the names of the items
   that the customer ordered and the total amount (including tax) that they have
   to pay.
   The orders should show the name and price.
